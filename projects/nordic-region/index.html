                    <p>
                        The Nordic Region consists of Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden, as well as the Faroe Islands, Greenland, and Åland. Its nature is unique – Long coastlines, deep forests, mountains, meadows and river valleys – from the Arctic tundra of the north to the warm, temperate parts of the south. The Gulf Stream may help maintain a mild climate in the Nordic Region, but climate change and encroaching civilization are a threat just as much as anywhere else in the world.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The region is sparsely populated, comprising huge expanses of unspoiled wilderness. Nordic nature has an abundance of plant life, lakes and rivers teeming with fish, and animals like deer, wild boar and elk. Most cities offer easy and direct access to the wild. Every year, people head to the beach to swim in the sea, pick berries and mushrooms in late summer, ski through white, sparkling landscapes, and walk in the woods to gather the first anemones of spring.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The Nordic welfare model is often hailed as a model in international forums. Few other countries in the world provide such a good and well-developed financial safety net for their citizens. The idea of equal opportunities for all is all-pervasive in the Nordic countries. In practice, it has resulted in huge efforts to reduce economic inequality.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The modern Nordic model is characterized by a public sector that provides its citizens with welfare services and a social safety net. Specifically, this includes child benefits, parental leave, health services and hospitals, all of which are free at the point of delivery. The public sector also looks after sick and unemployed people and senior citizens. The basic values underpinning the model are compassion, tolerance, and the conviction that all humans are of equal worth.

                        Denmark, the most southerly country in the Nordic Region, is a small, densely populated country, made up of a large number of islands skirted by lovely beaches. It borders Sweden to the east and Germany to the south. The Øresund Bridge connects Sweden to the largest Danish island, Zealand. Jutland, which is a peninsula, connects Denmark with Germany. The third-largest island in Denmark is Funen, which is connected to Zealand by the Great Belt Bridge and to Jutland by the Little Belt Bridge.

                    <p>
                        The most important sources of revenue in Denmark are oil and other forms of energy, the medical industry, agricultural produce, shipping and IT services.

                    <p>
                        The country has plenty of good arable land, and makes the most of this natural resource. It has a temperate climate, with frost and occasional snow in the winter. The average temperature is around 16°C in the summer and 0.5°C in the winter. Precipitation is at its highest in September, October and November and lowest in February and April.

                        Fisheries and rugged scenery characterize the Faroe Islands, an archipelago in the North Atlantic. The landscape is rugged with steep cliffs, grassy ridges and a very few trees. The Faroes consist of 18 islands. It has the smallest landmass of the three autonomous territories in the Nordic Region.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The Faroe Islands are part of the Kingdom of Denmark but have extensive home rule. The parliament is the highest authority in the islands. The country is not a member of the EU, but has entered into a fisheries and trading agreement with the Union.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Fishing is by far the most important industry in the Faroe Islands, and about 90% of exports consist of fishery products. Shipping and tourism are other important industries.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The Faroe Islands have mild winters and cool summers. Weather and precipitation levels vary greatly from island to island, with most rainfall in the north.

                        Finland is full of lakes and forests and is famous for its education system, Angry Birds, the Moomins and design. The forestry, technology and metal industries are Finland’s most important sources of income.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the north, Finland has land borders with its Nordic neighbors Norway and Sweden, and the three nations’ borders all meet at Treriksröset (The Three-Country Cairn). Finland also has a land border with Russia and sea borders with Estonia and Åland.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Finland is called “the land of a thousand lakes” as inland lakes and rivers make up 10% of the country. Large areas of forest cover almost two thirds of the land mass and only 6% of the country is arable. The climate is temperate in the south but sub-Arctic in parts of the north.

                        Although part of the North American continent, geopolitically Greenland is part of Europe. The country is member of the Kingdom of Denmark but has wide-ranging autonomy, which was extended in 2009. However, this does not include foreign and security policy or currency policy. Greenland is not a member of the EU, but has a special fisheries agreement and was accepted as one of the overseas countries and territories with special association with the EU.

                    <p>
                        Sealing, whaling, fishing and hunting are the main sources of income. The country also has a growing income from tourism as well as some mining.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Greenland is the world’s biggest island. Almost 80% of it is covered by the ice cap and glaciers. The ice-free area is almost as large as Sweden, but only a very small part of it is arable.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Greenland is in the polar zone, where winter temperatures reach as low as -50°C and summer temperatures rarely exceed 10–15°C. Due to its size, however, temperatures can vary considerably from one part of the country to another.

                        Fish and fishery products are still the country’s main source of income, followed by aluminium and ferrosilicon exports. In recent years, growth has been recorded in sectors such as biotechnology, software and tourism.

                        For many people, Norway is synonymous with oil and mountains, with dramatic and beautiful scenery – from the beaches and cliffs of the south, to the mountains in the middle and the midnight sun at the North Cape. It is a country of mountain ranges, huge forests, vast empty expanses and only about 3% arable land.

                    <p>
                        Norway has an extensive coastline and is surrounded by sea. Although long, it is not very wide. The scenery is varied and includes deep valleys and high mountains. Norway also includes the islands of Svalbard and Jan Mayen.

                        The climate in Norway is varied, reflecting the size of the country. In the north, close to the Finnish and Russian borders, winters are long and cold, in the south it is milder due to the coastal climate.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The biggest source of national income is the extraction and export of offshore oil and gas. Other significant industries include fishing, steel, shipping and tourism.

                        Åland consists of 6,757 islands situated midway between Sweden and Finland. Although part of Finland, Ålanders speak Swedish. Its largest island is Fasta Åland, where the capital Mariehamn is located. West of Åland lies the Sea of Åland, a waterway between Roslagen in Sweden and Åland. To the east, it borders the Åboland archipelago in Finland. The Åland archipelago boasts cliffs and heathlands, and there are large areas of coniferous forests. Roughly 9% of Åland is cultivable. It has a temperate climate with significant rainfall.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Although Åland is part of the Republic of Finland, it has its own autonomous parliament. In areas where Åland has its own legislation, the group of islands essentially operates as an independent nation. Åland is a demilitarized and neutral zone.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Important sources of income for Åland are shipping and ferry services, tourism, and the processing of agricultural and fishery products.
