        <h2>Backstory</h2>

        <p>
          When I was a kid, I was enthusiastic about Toy Story movies, and Mister Potato Head used to bring me so much joy. He was my favorite character.
        </p>

        <p>
          At the time I really wanted a replica of him, but due to my family's economic situation, I could not acquire one. So, I sat down and analyzed my possibilities, thinking about what I could do to solve that problem. The solution: I myself should make my toy! And that's what I did! Then, in order to achieve that dream, I performed the following steps:

          <h3>BODY:</h3>

          <ul>
            <li>
              Using a paintbrush and a mixture of glue and water, I glued several layers of small pieces of old newspapers and paper towels onto a balloon, leaving the spaces of the little holes (where we put the toy pieces) with nothing.
            </li>
            <li>
              After the paper body was dry, I popped the balloon and removed it from the inside through one of the little holes.

          <h3>PIECES:</h3>

          <ul>

              First, I drew the body parts on a piece of cardboard in order to have their shapes.
            </li>
            <li>
              For the pieces to be in high relief, I used crumpled newspaper and Scotch tape to mold them onto the cardboard.
            </li>
            <li>
              Then, I glued pieces of paper towels with the mixture of glue and water onto them.

              Afterwards, I painted all the pieces and the body.
            </li>
            <li>
              Finally, I applied varnish to give it a shine and more resistance.
